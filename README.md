# document-similarity

This project aims to explore and implement various algorithms for measuring the similarity between documents. By leveraging different mathematical approaches, we can determine how closely related two pieces of text are, which has applications in information retrieval, plagiarism detection, and content recommendation systems.

## Preprocessing

* Tokenization
* Lower casing
* Remove punctuations
* Remove stop words
* Stemming
* Lemmatizing (better than stemming)

## Jaccard's similarity

Jaccard's similarity measures the similarity between two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets.

To calculate Jaccard's similarity between two documents, we first tokenize the documents into sets of unique words and then apply the Jaccard formula.

## Euclidean Similarity

Euclidean similarity uses the Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between two documents. This approach requires representing documents as vectors in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a term in the document.

The Euclidean similarity is the inverse of the Euclidean distance between two document vectors.

## Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multidimensional space. It is particularly useful in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in [0,1].

## TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches, text mining, and user modeling.

The TF-IDF value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word.

### Components of TF-IDF:

**Term Frequency (TF):** This measures *how frequently* a term occurs in a document. Since every document is different in length, it's possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. Thus, the term frequency is often divided by the document length (aka. the total number of terms in the document) as a way of normalization:

`TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document)`

**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This measures *how important* a term is. While computing TF, all terms are considered equally important. However, certain terms, such as "is", "of", and "that", may appear a lot of times but have little importance. Thus we need to weigh down the frequent terms while scaling up the rare ones, by computing the following:

`IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it)`

**Calculating TF-IDF:**
The TF-IDF value is calculated by multiplying TF and IDF. So, for a term t in a document d, within a document set D, the TF-IDF score is calculated as:

`TF-IDF(t, d, D) = TF(t, d) Ã— IDF(t, D)`

The resulting scores can be used to rank the importance of terms within documents of a corpus, with *higher scores indicating greater importance*.

## Bag of Words

The Bag of Words (BoW) model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval. In this model, a text is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.

We call vectorization the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. This specific strategy (tokenization, counting and normalization) is called the Bag of Words or "Bag of n-grams" representation. Documents are described by word occurrences while completely ignoring the relative position information of the words in the document.


## Doc2Vec

Doc2Vec, also known as *Document Vector*, is an extension of the Word2Vec model, which is used to generate word embeddings. While Word2Vec focuses on converting words into high-dimensional vectors that capture *semantic relationships and context*, Doc2Vec extends this to entire documents or paragraphs, enabling the *representation of variable-length pieces of texts as fixed-length vectors*. 

A unique identifier (Paragraph ID or Document ID) is assigned to each document. This ID acts as a unique token during training, allowing the model to learn a vector for each document.

Doc2Vec has two primary architectures for training:

* Distributed Memory (DM)
* Distributed Bag of Words (DBOW)

### Training doc2vec on Wikipedia data

[Reference](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/docs/notebooks/doc2vec-wikipedia.ipynb)


### Limitations

**Training Complexity:** Training a Doc2Vec model requires a significant amount of data and computational resources.

### Results

Dataset used for training is a subset of [10-dataset-text-document-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jensenbaxter/10dataset-text-document-classification)

The accuracy of the trained model is subpar. Require high computational power and large dataset to train the model.

OR

Use a pretrained doc2vec model if available. For example, from [Pretrained Wikipedia Doc2Vec Models](https://github.com/kongyq/Pretrained_Wikipedia_Doc2Vec_Models?tab=readme-ov-file)



## Sentence similarity features and applications

### Fuzzy string matching

[Reference](https://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/)

Features that could be used to find fuzzy similarity between sentences:

* string similarity (edit distance)
* partial string similarity
* token sort
* token set

Some of the applications of finding similar sentences are:

* Question Answering Systems: solving Quora question pair similarity problem, 
* Information Retrieval: creating a website for pulling event tickets for a game or show from all over the internet and listing them in a single page, 
* Legal Document Analysis: finding and comparing similar cases or regulations within legal documents to aid in legal research or case preparation, 
* Medical Record Analysis: comparing patient reports and medical records to identify similar cases/treatments/outcomes for better diagnosis and treatment planning etc.
